##PREVIOUS RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

###Research Assistant - 2011-2014
Environmental Research Institute- University of Highlands & Islands, Thurso.	
Assisting on a variety of collaborative multidisciplinary EU projects that investigated the potential ecological effects of marine renewable energy. 

####Energymare
Monitoring the rate of bioaccumulation and the potential for fish aggregation around a wave energy converter using underwater cameras.

####Hebridean Marine Energy Futures.
Investigating the potential ecological impact of wave renewable energy devices on seabird distributions.  Spatial analysis and statistical modelling of seabird distributions using a long-term dataset of land-based seabird observations before and after deployment of a wave energy device. Responsible for the completion of the work package and the associated final report.

####MaREE
Investigating the overlap of seabird dive profiles and habitat use with marine renewable sites. Deploying GPS and TDR tags on European shags and black guillemots.

###Food and Environment Research Agency - 2010-2011		
Field and laboratory support for projects within the Wildlife Management team. Assisting with the trapping of small to large mammals, and deployment of RADAR to monitor bird movement through offshore energy developments. 

###Senior Research Assistant - Royal Society for Protection of Birds - 2009 
Completing extensive surveys of upland breeding birds and nest trapping golden plover, and fitting VHF tags to both adults and chicks.
