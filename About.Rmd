I am a movement ecologist nearing the end of my PhD on European lobster. The aim of my research was to better understand movement of free-ranging lobsters in order to improve estimates of relative abundance, and improve the sustainability of European lobster stocks. 

I have been using fine-scale acoustic telemetry data to quantify individual behaviour of lobster in the presence and absence of traps, quantify the spatial overlap and dynamic interactions between lobsters, and investigate the environmental drivers of lobster movement.
